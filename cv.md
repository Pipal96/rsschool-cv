* My first name - **Ivan**, last name - **Mitrofanov** :squirrel:

* My my mobile number - **+79277666235**. I in socialnetwork [VK](https://vk.com/ivanmit). I in socialnetwork [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bee_bz_bz/?hl=ru). 
* My goal is to get a job at EPAM :heart:. Why do you ask? Because more than a year ago, I learned about this company, and then I realized that I wanted to work there and nowhere else. I enrolled in EPAM courses 3 times and always did not pass the requirements. This is my fourth attempt and I hope the last.
It is important for me to get into EPAM, because I believe that this is exactly what work should be. Interesting tasks, a large and friendly team, good work and, most importantly for me, this is the presence of social activities. For example, I am a blood donor.

* I am fluent in HTML & CSS and am constantly trying to learn something new. My so far weakness is Java Script, but I'll definitely catch up. I am able to use LESS, Bootstrap and some git.

* Experience in creating about 8-10 sites, the last ones I learned to use semantics, grid layout and BEM from Yandex. BEM was not implemented correctly in the latest layouts, but there is already an understanding of how to do it correctly. With git, I'm still on "you", so I hope I placed the last work correctly.
