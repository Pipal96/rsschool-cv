* My first name - **Ivan**, last name - **Mitrofanov** :squirrel:

* My my mobile number - **+79277666235**. I in socialnetwork [VK](https://vk.com/ivanmit). I in socialnetwork [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bee_bz_bz/?hl=ru). 
* My goal is to get a job at EPAM :heart:. Why do you ask? Because more than a year ago, I learned about this company, and then I realized that I wanted to work there and nowhere else. I enrolled in EPAM courses 3 times and always did not pass the requirements. This is my fourth attempt and I hope the last.
It is important for me to get into EPAM, because I believe that this is exactly what work should be. Interesting tasks, a large and friendly team, good work and, most importantly for me, this is the presence of social activities. For example, I am a blood donor.

* I am fluent in HTML & CSS and am constantly trying to learn something new. My so far weakness is Java Script, but I'll definitely catch up. I am able to use LESS, Bootstrap and some git.
